Code for novel finite-volume averaged-based methods for solving the nonlinear degenerate parabolic Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME) in the following two papers:

* Modified Harmonic Method (MHM): [Numerical artifacts in the Generalized Porous Medium Equation: Why harmonic averaging itself is not to blame](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199911830086X), Danielle C. Maddix, Luiz Sampaio, Margot Gerritsen, *Journal of Computational Physics*, 361, pp. 280-298, 2018.

* Shock-based Averaging Method (SAM): [Numerical artifacts in the discontinuous Generalized Porous Medium Equation: How to avoid spurious temporal oscillations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199911830278X), Danielle C. Maddix, Luiz Sampaio, Margot Gerritsen, *Journal of Computational Physics*, 368, pp. 277-298, 2018.

`parabolic_plots.m` is the main script that generates the plots and the equations and parameters are set in `testProblem.m`
